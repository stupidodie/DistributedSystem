# How to run the program
1. Open three terminal, all under the "ASSIGNMENT4" directory;
2. input:  go run . "1"  to one terminal
3. input:  go run . "2"  to another terminal
4. input:  go run . "3"  to the third terminal(order doesn't matter)
Then you will find the three nodes are passing token automatically every 3 seconds.

# After you run it
We prepare 3 task for each node, which will let the node enter a "critical section" 
when it has token and user press enter.
To test the function, simply press enter at any time in any terminal and have fun!
